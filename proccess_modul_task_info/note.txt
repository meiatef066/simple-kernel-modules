    Process ID (PID) – The unique identifier for the process.
    Parent Process ID (PPID) – The PID of the parent process.
    Process Name – The command or executable name of the process.
    State – The current state of the process (e.g., Running, Sleeping, Stopped, Zombie).
    User ID (UID) – The user ID of the process owner.
    Group ID (GID) – The group ID of the process owner.
    Priority & Nice Value – The process priority and its niceness value.
    CPU Time (User & System Time) – The amount of time the process has spent in user and kernel mode.
    Start Time – When the process started, relative to system boot time.
    Virtual Memory Size (VmSize) – The total amount of virtual memory used by the process.
    Resident Set Size (RSS) – The actual physical memory occupied by the process.
    Number of Threads – The number of threads the process has.

How to Retrieve This Information in a Kernel Module

    Use find_vpid(pid) to get the struct pid of a given PID.
    Use pid_task() to retrieve the task_struct of the process.
    Access fields from struct task_struct, such as:
        task->pid for PID
        task->comm for process name
        task->state for process state
        task->parent->pid for PPID
        task->real_cred->uid.val for UID
        task->real_cred->gid.val for GID
        task->prio for priority
        task->mm->total_vm for virtual memory
        task->mm->rss_stat.count for RSS memory
        task->start_time for process start time

Best Practices for Building a Kernel Module for Task Representation

To ensure efficiency, safety, and maintainability, follow these best practices when designing your /proc/pid kernel module.
1️⃣ Safe Handling of User Input

✅ Use copy_from_user() Safely

    Always check if copy_from_user() succeeds to prevent kernel crashes.

if (copy_from_user(kmem, usr_buf, count)) {
    kfree(kmem);
    return -EFAULT;  // Return error if copy fails
}

✅ Limit Input Size to Prevent Buffer Overflows

    Only allow writing a valid integer PID (e.g., up to 10 digits).

if (count > 10) {
    return -EINVAL;  // Invalid input size
}

2️⃣ Efficiently Access Kernel Data Structures

✅ Use find_vpid() + pid_task() Instead of Iterating Over All Tasks

    Avoid scanning the entire process list (expensive). Instead, use:

struct pid *pid_struct = find_vpid(stored_pid);
struct task_struct *task = pid_task(pid_struct, PIDTYPE_PID);

✅ Check If task_struct is NULL

    Always handle invalid or terminated PIDs gracefully.

if (!task) {
    return snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "No such process\n");
}

3️⃣ Avoid Kernel Memory Leaks

✅ Use kmalloc() Only When Necessary, Always kfree()

    Allocate memory only if required and free it when done.

char *kmem = kmalloc(count, GFP_KERNEL);
if (!kmem) return -ENOMEM;  // Handle memory allocation failure

copy_from_user(kmem, usr_buf, count);
kfree(kmem);  // Always free allocated memory

❌ Don't Allocate Memory on Every Read Operation

    Use a static buffer instead of kmalloc() in proc_read().

4️⃣ Ensure Atomic Access to Shared Data

✅ Use spinlock_t for Synchronization

    If multiple processes access /proc/pid, use a lock to prevent race conditions.

static spinlock_t pid_lock;  // Define spinlock

spin_lock(&pid_lock);
stored_pid = new_pid;
spin_unlock(&pid_lock);

This prevents issues where one process reads an incomplete PID update from another process.
5️⃣ Follow Kernel Coding Standards

✅ Use Kernel Logging Instead of printf()

    Always use printk() for debugging.

printk(KERN_INFO "Stored PID: %ld\n", stored_pid);

✅ Avoid Floating Point Operations

    The kernel does not support floating-point math; avoid it.

✅ Check Kernel Version Compatibility

    Use #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE to ensure compatibility across kernel versions.

6️⃣ Consider Extending the Module for More Features

🔥 Optional Enhancements:

    Support multiple PIDs instead of just one.
    Track additional process details like:
        CPU usage (task->utime)
        Memory usage (task->mm->total_vm)
    Implement a notification mechanism using wait_event() to alert users when a process state changes.

💡 Summary: The Best Approach for Task Representation
Best Practice	Why?
✅ Use find_vpid() & pid_task()	Efficiently access process data
✅ Validate user input (copy_from_user())	Prevents crashes and bad data
✅ Handle NULL cases for invalid PIDs	Avoids kernel crashes
✅ Use kmalloc() only when needed	Prevents memory leaks
✅ Use spinlock_t if shared data is modified	Prevents race conditions
✅ Follow kernel coding conventions	Ensures maintainability
